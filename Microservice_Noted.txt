Monolithic Archetecture 
> is Archetecture that have single code base.

Fault tolerance mean System still work while have some parts met the problem.


> Advantage of Microservice:
1. Easy to Develop. Test and Deploy of each module
2. Practice Agile Methodology
3. Easy Scale each service
4. All team can develop the same time
5. Each Service can use diff technology

Microservice is  method to develop application to small service 
that can run independence and can communnicate with other service
